Do not add .lua scripts here!
Lua scripts in this folder will not be loaded on all songs, no matter the difficulty, song name, week or anything.

If you've put it inside a modpack, as long as the modpack is loaded, the script will only be running if you tell another script to run it.

NOTE:
If you're confused on why these scripts went unused, it's because the sheer amount of them got out of hand, and they had to be condensed.
