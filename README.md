# Funkin' in Sunny Side Skies
Sing against characters from soaporsalad's webcomic Sunny Side Skies, like Kristen and Chase. There's even Unfamiliar and Toaster Dude, some of her other comics! There are also a fair amount of easter eggs to discover, so start hunting for those, too!

## v5 Update
The last major update is finally here! This is a near complete rewrite of the original, plus even more content and cool new menus!

## Credits
**dombomb64:** Me! I did 99.9% of the mod's programming, art, and other stuff. Yep, this was made almost entirely by one person.

**soaporsalad:** The creator of Sunny Side Skies, Unfamiliar, and Toaster Dude. If she didn't start making comics, I honestly have no clue where I'd be today.
**Little Bobler:** The artist for the reboot of Toaster Dude. They did an insane job on the art for it, go check it out.

**deltuh:** He wanted to chart a song, so I let him chart Alacrity. Check out his YouTube channel if you like Quaver, Roblox, and Geometry Dash.
**Colin Cartoons:** He made the EDM remix of the menu theme, Sunny Side. He also makes cool animation videos on YouTube.

**Psych Engine Team:** Made the base engine for this mod.

And You, for playing the mod! Differently formatted because you're special. ;)
