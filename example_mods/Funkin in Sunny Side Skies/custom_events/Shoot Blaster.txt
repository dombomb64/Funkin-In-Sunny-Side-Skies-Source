Shoot a fireball from a blaster.

NOTE: Although blasters disappear after their fireball
finishes exploding, their names are not removed from
their array, so each blaster always has an ID of one
greater than that of the previous one.
The array starts at 1.

Value 1: Blaster ID Number
Value 2: Type in anything to print all blaster IDs.
