Flip a character's sprite on the X axis.

Value 1: Character to flip
Value 2: None

NOTE: Characters that get tagged in and out
for the same variable aren't the same object,
so you may need to adjust the timing of the
event until after the character is swapped out
, omit the event entirely if the character was
flipped previously, or run this event when
you wouldn't think to.
